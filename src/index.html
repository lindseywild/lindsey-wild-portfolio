          <h3>The Better Institute</h3>
          <p>Jody & Rob at The Better Institute needed a website for their new company. One that they could update
            themselves easily, with a clean and modern design. It has been expanded to include a client portal where
            a client is able to take virtual coaching courses. WordPress was chosen for ease of updating, and
            incorporates LearnDash LMS &amp; WooCommerce.</p>

          <h3>PERSOMA PC</h3>
          <p>Aaron at PERSOMA PC needed a refreshed and new website. He wanted a clean design that makes clients feel
            welcome. It needed to be easy to update by their team, so WordPress was used. A training session was also
            held to teach their team to use WordPress and make updates on their own.</p>

          <h3>DICK'S Sporting Goods â€“ Shoe Release Calendar</h3>
          <p>This has since been redesigned, but there were two parts to this project: the user-facing front-end and
            the back-end tool to add, delete, or update shoes. The back-end application was built in AngularJS and
            allowed site merchandises (who were not developers) to use forms to make updates to the calendar. An API
            was used to connect the tool to the front-end, allowing for almost real-time updates on the live website.
            The front-end was build using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript.</p>

          <h3>Giant Eagle - Curbside Express Landing Page</h3>
          <p>This has since been redesigned, but the initial pictured design was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
            jQuery. It was a mobile-first built website that allowed a user to select a location and then enter the
            online grocery shopping process.</p>
